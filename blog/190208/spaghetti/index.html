        This is my first ever blog post so I hope I don't ramble too much.

        There are a lot of programming languages. A lot.
        <a href="https://rosettacode.org">Rosetta Code</a> lists
        <a href="https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Programming_Languages">
          714 of them</a>, as of the date of this post. Just like human languages,
        it's really difficult to map them on family trees, because they
        continuously evolve and have numerous dialects of varying mutual
        intelligibility, informal dialects, different incompatible versions and
        divergent implementations.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, unlike natural languages, programming languages have a
        significantly more problematic property that makes them nigh impossible
        to cleanly reduce into pretty graphs: They're arbitrarily constructed. A
        natural language simply descends from a previous language, and languages
        form trees. Of course, interlanguage influence is widespread (and let's
        not forget that there are pidgins, creoles and, of course, constructed
        languages). Even then, it's still perfectly possible (if not feasible)
        to trace each language's ancestor back.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reason tracing geneological roots is infeasible in software is
        simply because we "unorganically" take various influences from here and
        there and sculpt a whole new project. This gets especially more
        problematic with newer multi-paradigm languages that borrow something
        from everyone! Whilst borrowing a few words from another language
        doesn't align a natural language's lineage, borrowing a considerable
        amount of semantics or syntax from another language completely alters a
        programming language's lineage.
      </p>

      <p>
        For instance, ask yourself: Where does Python come from? Graphs I found
        online gave me various ridiculous answers, such as C, Perl and even
        Java. Of course, you say to yourself, the answer is CLU, right? Not
        quite. How about Rust? Where does it come from? The answer is,
        unfortunately, a bit of everything.
      </p>

      <p>
        Still, I thought to myself, it sure would be nice to see even a sloppy
        graph, showing maybe <strong>just</strong> the direct influences. It
        would be simpler if I just didn't include languages like Java!
      </p>

      <p>
        Last year, August, I was chatting with my
        friend <a href="https://baturin.org">Daniil</a> on IRC and he showed me
        the blogpost he was working on, an
        <a href="https://blog.baturin.org/introduction-to-ocaml.html">
          Introduction to OCaml</a>. He had made a very simple family tree of the
        three main functional programming language families from which all else
        descends. (I exaggerate, but you get my point.)

        I thought that was fascinating. I tried to find similar graphs but, much
        to my chagrin, they were all either way too reductionistic, or, well,
        seemed to have strange preconceptions about what defines a
        language. Hard to blame them, really.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of taking such an approach, I tried to go by what the languages'
        respective users (or enthusiasts, in case of historic languages) go by
        and set out to make my very own incomplete and sloppy graph.

        Unfortunately, I gave up halfway through and mothballed it in a single
        Graphviz dot file and completely forgot about it by October.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just today, I discovered it in the random junk I had stashed
        in <a href="gopher://suika.erkin.party/1/files">my gopherspace</a>.
        I brought it up
        in <a href="ircs://freenode.net/#lobsters"><code>#lobsters</code></a>
        and talked about how I made it. Much to my surprise, people encouraged
        me to make a blogpost out of it so I'll try to describe what I remember
        from making this.

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        You can probably guess that I'm not well-versed in a good portion of
        these languages, nor their historical backgrounds. I picked the most
        straightforward ethod and simply asked people who are and consulted the
        mighty information superhighway when that failed. Wikipedia has
        "influences" and "influenced" sections in infoboxes of programming
        language articles, just like those of artists and
        philosophers. Unfortunately, it's rather lax about what can be
        considered influences, so I had to narrow it down a bit with independent
        research.
      </p>

      <p>
        I considered design choices as of the language's birth more important
        than later additions, even if they were slowly eclipsed by foreign
        influences in later versions.
      </p>

      <!-- <h3>Lisps</h3> -->
      <!-- <p> -->
      <!--   Let's take Lisp. Is Lisp a single language? Are the fragmented Lisp -->
      <!--   "dialects" from Lisp Machine era separate languages? Are CLOS and Loops -->
      <!--   languages at all? Is Racket a Scheme implementation or a -->
      <!--   Scheme-descended language on its own? -->
      <!--   (Of course, there are no single answers to these questions. After all, -->
      <!--   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_language_is_a_dialect_with_an_army_and_navy"> -->
      <!--     a language is a dialect with an army and fleet</a>!) -->
      <!-- </p> -->

      <!-- <p> -->
      <!--   Honestly, Lisp was especially problematic, as most recent Lisps can be -->
      <!--   said to descend from Common Lisp and Scheme at the same time, which -->
      <!--   tells you nothing at all. -->
      <!-- </p> -->

      <!-- <h3>Basics</h3> -->
      <!-- <p> -->
      <!--   This was the simplest one. -->
      <!-- </p> -->

      <!-- <h3>Shells</h3> -->
      <!-- <p> -->
      <!--   This was the most painful one. There's a myriad of different Unix shell -->
      <!--   implementations out there with completely varying degrees of -->
      <!--   compatibility and it's nigh-impossible to map them into a neat tree. -->
      <!-- </p> -->
