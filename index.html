<header> <h1>About Me</h1> </header>
<p>
I am an amateur/hobby software developer.
I also have a small <a href="http://blog.concision.tk">journal</a> which I irregularly update.
I would put my resumé here to show off my LaTeX skills but I don't have much to put on it.
My main Linux distribution of choice is Arch Linux and my favourite text editor is GNU emacs.

<h2>My hobbies/pastimes</h2>
<p>I do realise that this reads like a halfhearted college application but please bear with me.</p>
<p>(In no particular order.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading on the history and geography of the timeline which spans between Early Modern Ages and present day.</li>
<li>Writing drawings on my graphical calculator.</li>
<li>Listening to music. I especially like progressive rock and jazz fusion. I have a small collection of old vinyl records which I hold dear. I should make one of those tiny music review blogs that nobody ever reads. <a href="http://last.fm/Users/ErkinBatu/">My Last.FM profile</a>.</li>
<li>Trying to solve mathematical problems with computational power (such as ProjectEuler). I like mathematics, even though I have trouble understanding certain concepts. My favourite mathematicians are Paul Erdős and Cahit Arf.</li>
<li>Studying Japanese and Lojban languages.</li>
<li>Reading. Absurdism/Theater of the Absurd is my favourite literary genre (most likely because I'm fond of absurdism in philosophy as well). My favourite authors are Douglas Adams and Samuel Beckett. (They might sound highly unrelated but one's lighthearted and the other's gloomy points of view make their works delightful to read.)</li>
<li>Albeit I'm horribly unskilled at cryptography, I like solving cryptographical puzzles every now and then.</li>
<li>Researching Turkic language etymologies and the proposed Altaic language family theory.</li>
<li>Translating Free/Open Source Software to Turkish. (I used to be in the Ubuntu Turkish translation team, back when I used Ubuntu.)</li>
<li>Teaching my friends anything I know that they're willing to learn (For example; I teach my underclassmen C and I teach Japanese to some of my friends.). I have so much to learn but I want to share as much as I can.</li>
</ul>
<h2>My preferences</h2>
<p>My languages of choice are the following:
<ul>
  <li><b>Skilled</b></li><ul>
    <li><em>n/a</em></li></ul>
  <li><b>Intermediate</b></li><ul>
    <li>Haskell</li></ul>
  <li><b>Learning</b></li><ul>
    <li>Rust</li>
    <li>Matlab</li></ul>
  <li><b>Rusty</b></li><ul>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>Python (Was my first language.)</li>
    <li>Prolog (To be honest, I never fully understood this language.)</li>
    <li>Perl</li></ul>
</ul>
<h3>Other</h3><ul>
  <li><b>Text editor:</b> emacs and ed.</li>
  <li><b>Keyboard:</b> Cheap rubber dome keyboard with self-arranged keys for Dvorak plus extensions for Esperanto and Turkish.
    I should get an ergonomic keyboard with mechanical keyswitches someday.</li>
  <li><b>Operating system:</b> Mainly Arch Linux. I have installations of Gentoo and FreeBSD sitting on my hard drive.
    Someday, I will defeat my procrastination and configure them.
    I name my computers and hosts after wine varieties.
    Red and white wine for desktop and mobile hosts respectively. My main machine is called shiraz.</li>
  <li><b>Window manager:</b> I don't have a desktop environment but I have been using awesome as my main window manager for quite a long time.
    I want to switch to xmonad but I can't find the motivation to do so since I have settled with awesome.</li>
</ul>
<h2>My projects/ideas</h2>
<p>(That somehow didn't get dumped.)</p>
<ul>
<li>A programming language for theorem proving and mathematical logic called "Arf," which utilises M-expressions. <a href="arf.html">Just a concept idea.</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>If you want/need to reach me for any reason, you can reach me at <code>b64decode('ZXJraW5iYXR1QGdtYWlsLmNvbQ==')</code>.</p>
<p>I usually go by the nick <b>erkin</b> on IRC and most places on the net (sometimes <b>ErkinBatu</b> if the former nick is taken).</p>
<p>And <a href="pubkey.txt">here</a>'s my public GPG key.</p>
