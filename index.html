<header><h1>About Me</h1></header>
<p>I am an amateur/hobby software developer. I usually go by the nick <b>erkin</b> on IRC and most places on the net (sometimes <b>ErkinBatu</b> if the nick is taken).
I have a small <a href="http://concision.tk">journal</a> which I irregularly update.
I would put my resum√© here to show off my LaTeX skills but I don't have much to put on it.
My main programming language is Haskell, my Linux distribution of choice is Arch Linux and my favourite text editor is GNU emacs.
If you want/need to reach me for some reason, you can reach me at <code>b64decode('ZXJraW5iYXR1QGdtYWlsLmNvbQ==')</code>.</p>

<h2>My hobbies/pastimes</h2>
<p>(In no particular order.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading on the history and geography of the timeline which spans between Early Modern Ages and present day.</li>
<li>Writing drawings on my graphical calculator.</li>
<li>Listening to music. I especially like progressive rock and jazz fusion. I have a small collection of old vinyl records which I hold dear. I should make one of those tiny music review blogs that nobody ever reads.</li>
<li>Trying to solve mathematical problems with computational power (such as <a href="https://projecteuler.org">ProjectEuler</a>).</li>
<li>Studying Japanese language and Lojban.</li>
<li>Reading. Absurdism/Theater of the Absurd is my favourite literary genre (most likely because I'm fond of absurdism in philosophy as well). My favourite authors are Douglas Adams and Samuel Beckett. (They might sound highly unrelated but one's lighthearted and the other's gloomy points of view make their works delightful to read.)</li>
<li>Albeit I'm absolutely horrible at cryptography, I like solving cryptographical puzzles now and then.</li>
<li>Researching Turkic language etymologies and the proposed Altaic language family theory.</li>
<li>Translating Free/Open Source Software to Turkish. (I used to be in the Ubuntu Turkish translation team, back when I used Ubuntu.)</li>
<li>Teaching my friends anything I know that they're willing to learn (For example, I teach my underclassmen C and I teach some of my friends Japanese.). I have so much to learn but I want to share as much as I can.</li>
</ul>
<h2>My projects/ideas</h2>
<p>(That somehow didn't get dumped.)</p>
<ul>
<li>An unnamed "geometry" language that utilises M-expressions. <a href="geometry.html">Just a concept idea.</a></li>
</ul>
