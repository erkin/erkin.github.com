<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Arf is my programming language idea, proposal and plan. Its syntax is based on M-expressions. Its semantics are "kinda" object-oriented, and it is strongly and statically typed. It is named after the mathematician Cahit Arf and is not related to the onomatop≈ìia of the dog's cry, nor is it an acronym.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>Defining values:</p>
<code>
include(mathstypes)<br />
## Functions are separated from variables with the format of <em>name(argument)</em><br />
a[int](3)<br />
## Every variable follows the format of <em>name[type](value)</em> Every variable <strong>must</strong> have a value.<br />
## There are plenty of pre-defined types (some include others, for example "num" includes "int") but it is also easy to define a new type.<br />
b[coord[2]](12,~3)<br />
## Types such as coordinates can take more than one value.<br />
## Types can have types too. In this case, "coord" has a type of "2", indicating it is two dimensional.<br />
## Type-types are obviously optional, the parser can recognise it in most cases.<br />
## "~" indicates a negative value, to avoid confusion with "-" the numeric operation.<br />
## (Though this is not mandatory as the plane can have varying number of dimensions if the type-type is not set.)<br />
