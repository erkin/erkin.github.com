{"name":"~erkin","tagline":"","body":"# About\r\nI am a Turkish software developer. I will put my résumé here when it is done.\r\n\r\n## Hobbies & Interests\r\n* Reading. I especially like post-modernist works (mainly absurdism and the Theatre of Absurd), early science fiction and fantasy. My favourite authors are Douglas Adams and Samuel Beckett.\r\n* Solving Project Euler problems.\r\n* Studying linguistics, history and geography leisurely when I have nothing else to do.\r\n* Contributing to FOSS translation projects.\r\n* Listening to music. [Here](http://www.last.fm/user/ErkinBatu) is my Last.FM profile.\r\n\r\n## Languages\r\nThe only language I am strong with is Haskell. I also know C and Python at a basic level. I try to write all my papers in LaTeX (unless I am short on time).  \r\nAs for natural languages; I speak native Turkish, near-native English and near-fluent Japanese.\r\n\r\n## Preferences\r\nMy text editor of choice is GNU emacs. I use ed in times of emergency.  \r\nMy keyboard is a cheap rubber-dome switch keyboard, using Dvorak (which I have modified with extensions for Turkish). I am planning to obtain an ergonomic keyboard with mechanical keyswitches in the future.  \r\nThe operating system I use is Arch Linux, using the kernel linux-ck optimised for AMD K10.  \r\nI am using awesome for window manager but I am planning to switch to xmonad.\r\n\r\n## Projects\r\n*I have not finished a single serious project. All my projects until now were either silly or incomplete. You can view my GitHub page to view a few of them. This section will be updated.*\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nIf you need or want to reach me, my main e-mail address is `b64decode('ZXJraW5iYXR1QGdtYWlsLmNvbQ==')`.  \r\nOn IRC, I use the nick `e` on EsperNet and `erkin` on FreeNode.  \r\nMy public GPG key can be seen [here](/pubkey.txt).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
